--Overview--
End-to-End Snowflake Data Pipeline RAW–SILVER–GOLD | SCD-2 | Time Travel | Fail-safe | Views | Materialized Views | Query Profile | Zero-Copy Cloning

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data warehousing solution built on Snowflake, following modern medallion architecture principles. It showcases the ingestion of semi-structured JSON data into a Raw layer, transformation and deduplication in a Silver layer, and historized, business-ready data in a Gold layer using Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD Type 2) techniques.
The solution further models the curated data into both Star and Snowflake schemas, enabling efficient analytical queries and BI reporting. The project highlights best practices in data modeling, change data tracking, and SQL-based transformations commonly used in real-world enterprise data platforms.

----RAW Layer----

The RAW layer stores source data exactly as received in JSON format, preserving full history. It acts as the system of record and supports auditing, reprocessing, and schema evolution.

----SILVER Layer----

The SILVER layer cleans and structures RAW data into typed columns. Duplicate records are removed using window functions, keeping only the latest record per business key. The layer is fully re-runnable and idempotent.

----GOLD Layer (SCD Type-2)----

The GOLD layer contains business-ready data using SCD Type-2 to track historical changes. Hash-based change detection and MERGE logic ensure accurate updates, auditability, and safe reprocessing.

---- & Materialized Views----

Views provide a logical layer for simplified access and always show the latest data without storing it. Materialized views store precomputed results to improve performance for frequent or complex queries.

----STAR & Snowflake Schema----

The STAR schema uses a central fact table with denormalized dimensions for fast analytics. The Snowflake schema further normalizes dimensions to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.

----Time Travel----

Time Travel allows querying historical data using timestamps or statement IDs. It enables recovery from accidental updates or deletes within the retention period without backups.

----Fail-safe----

Fail-safe is Snowflake’s last-resort recovery option after Time Travel expires. It provides disaster recovery support through Snowflake Support.

----Zero-Copy Cloning----

Zero-Copy Cloning creates instant snapshots of tables without copying data. It is used for testing, validation, and recovery with minimal storage cost.

----Query Profile & Performance----

Query Profile helps analyze query execution, data scanned, and performance. Result caching allows repeated queries to run instantly, reducing cost and improving efficiency.
